	<p>Once, a hardworking blackberry farmer, Zach Axin now wanders the country side looking for vengeance. Years ago, his love was stolen from him by a group of raiders in the night, and set their farm on fire as they fled. One night, after six months of grueling searching, a massive thunderstorm rolled through. Pouring rain, and on the verge of dying, Zach Axin raised his fists into the sky and yelled curses at the gods. Two lightning bolts boomed from the sky and hit Zach Axin's clenched hands, creating an explosion all around him. When Zach Axin awoke the next day, his body surged with power and a his mind, clear with purpose. He now had the strength and will to carry out his vengeance. It only took a year before he found the raiders and their camp. He destroyed everything in his search but it was too late. His love had been killed before he got there. Now he continues his journey, searching for a way to revive his lost love, fueled by the power of lightning, never stopping to rest.</p>
